,,"This reminds me of jan Misali&#x27;s analysis of Hangman (in fact the title is so similar that I&#x27;m inclined to believe that it&#x27;s definitely inspired despite not mentioning the video or Misali by name) [^1]. In any case, I&#x27;m obviously inclined to agree that they&#x27;re both weird games, and that the weirdness comes from their fundamental asymmetry. It definitely reminds me of a sort of ritualized play, where an asymmetry is &quot;artificially&quot; constructed for the purpose of being broken down. There&#x27;s a fictionalized power dynamic that gets produced, yet the erosion of this dynamic isn&#x27;t just the point, it&#x27;s often aided by the one in power (how many times have I given my friends hints or extra chances in both games).<p>&gt; It’s cooperative because everyone is ultimately working toward a common goal: deducing the answer<p>I think this point gets pretty close to why these games are fun or interesting to begin with. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily because that they teach you about a person based on the object they choose or the guesses they make, but the fact that the game operates at all. In some sense it&#x27;s like a puzzle, but unlike a puzzle doesn&#x27;t just operate on its prima facie rules - because if you can&#x27;t solve a puzzle then that&#x27;s just too bad, but if 20 questions doesn&#x27;t end then something is off. In seems that 20 questions is interesting because there are social conventions within which it operates and playing by those conventions seems to demonstrate a social and emotional understanding that power dynamics within the relationship will be cooperatively undermined.<p>[^1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;le5uGqHKll8"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;le5uGqHKll8</a>",,lofatdairy,,1668494796,2022-11-15 06:46:36 UTC,comment,33606052,33602716,,,

,,"I think it depends on the circumstances what you should do. Such as whether the client has a real budget. Honestly for me it is relatively trivial to find clients with shoestring budgets versus adequate ones.<p>But ideally you set things up ahead of time by finding a client with a decent sized budget and then charging by the week. The billing increment is one week.<p>Then just make sure to have regular delivery or discussions as often as possible with the client. They should see the deliverables progressing, even if it&#x27;s just the architectural details being worked out at first. They should be judging based on useful things obviously happening and being explained or being able to use the next version rather than just looking at hours to try to guess whether they are getting a good deal or something.<p>For me, we will see how it goes. Right now I have a weekly billing client who I am a bit worried I will have to replace because things in this niche are so dead right now. But there were a few other projects I may be able to pick up. I am definitely going to try to find one that can afford a week or two though because realistically all of the projects have gone on for more than two weeks so far, generally speaking more like 2-8 weeks each.<p>When it&#x27;s going to almost certainly take a month to complete a project, trying to get out of an extra hour every day or something is a questionable strategy because it&#x27;s a significant investment anyway,  and the biggest risk really is most projects just not delivering usable software at all, which means all of that money gets wasted.",,ilaksh,,1668528860,2022-11-15 16:14:20 UTC,comment,33611055,33610147,,,

,,"None of this is exactly rocket surgery, but here’s the gist of what I try to do when I need to refer a client to someone in another market…<p>Try to understand their business. Every agent should be able to explain their niche within a market and their unique value proposition. This is a straightforward way to separate the professional agent from the “accidental” agent. Speaking candidly, there are a lot of people who fall into the business chasing dollars who have a very limited range of skills. Unfortunately, you can make it in a lot of markets on personality, even if your clients are getting utterly screwed on all the things that actually count, IE: pricing, overall market analysis, negotiating, understanding local regulations (zoning, water, environmental, etc).<p>Listen to how they describe their market. I was talking to a “top performer” in my market the other day who was still regurgitating the same story from a year ago about “low inventory” when in fact there’s more inventory at every price point than at any time in the past three years. I’m certainly if I had decided to challenge their statements that they would have had no idea how many properties are on the market and that have taken price cuts in the past 30 days. A lot of those top performers are really good at churning deals rather than actually serving their clients. And, they may do a lot of business because they are willing to work for a low commission: if they won’t even fight for their own commission, why should you believe they are going to work hard at the negotiating table for you?<p>Finally, find someone who communicates with you in the way and at the pace you want. If you find it difficult to talk with them and to express what you need &#x2F; get the info you need, it’s only going to get worse when you are in the middle of a transaction.<p>Hope that’s useful!",,poulsbohemian,,1668539771,2022-11-15 19:16:11 UTC,comment,33613600,33607304,,,
